# PR.2-Logical-Box
🧠 Logic Box  
### Pattern Generator & Number Analyzer (Python Project)

## 📌 Overview
Logic Box is a simple Python program that helps beginners practice **control structures**, **loops**, **nested loops**, and **control statements** such as `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.  
The program offers two main features:

1. **Pattern Generator** – Generates a right-angled triangle pattern using nested loops.  
2. **Number Analyzer** – Analyzes numbers in a user-defined range and displays whether each number is odd or even, along with the total sum.

This project is ideal for students learning Python basics and logical problem-solving.

## 🎯 Features

### 1️⃣ Pattern Generator
- Accepts number of rows from the user  
- Uses:
  - `for` loops  
  - nested loops  
  - `break` for invalid row input  
- Generates a **right-angled star triangle**

### 2️⃣ Number Analyzer
- Accepts a **start** and **end** number  
- Displays:
  - Whether each number is Odd / Even  
  - Total sum of all numbers in the range  
- Uses:
  - `for` loop  
  - `range()`  
  - `pass` as a placeholder

## 🧩 Flow of the Program

1. Show main menu  
2. User selects an option  
3. Depending on the option, show the required inputs  
4. Display results  
5. Return to main menu until user chooses **Exit**

## 🖥️ Example Console Output

Welcome to the Pattern Generator and Number Analyzer!

Select an option:

1. Generate a Pattern
2. Analyze a Range of Numbers
3. Exit Enter your choice: 1

Enter the number of rows for the pattern: 5

Pattern: *
         **
         ***
         ****
         *****
Select an option:

1. Generate a Pattern
2. Analyze a Range of Numbers
3. Exit Enter your choice: 2

Enter the start of the range: 10 Enter the end of the range: 15

Number 10 is Even Number 11 is Odd Number 12 is Even Number 13 is Odd Number 14 is Even Number 15 is Odd

Sum of all numbers from 10 to 15 is: 75

Select an option:

1. Generate a Pattern
2. Analyze a Range of Numbers
3. Exit Enter your choice: 3
Exiting the program. Goodbye!
